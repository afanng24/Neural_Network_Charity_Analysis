# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of Project
The objective of Neural Network Charity Analysis is to use the provided dataset named “charity_data.csv” and figure out a way to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. To accomplish this task, we must consider which variables are considered the targets for our model, what variables are considered to be the features for our model, and what variables are neither ratgets nor features and to remove them. After the model is complete we will refactor our code to increase performance by creating more hidden layers, adding more neurons to the hidden layers and adding epochs to the training regimen. 

## Resources
**Source of Data** : charity_data.csv

**Software** : Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook,

## Results
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compling, training and evaluating the model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
